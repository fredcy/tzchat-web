The [Riot/Matrix services for tzchat.org accounts](https://riot.tzchat.org) are
now available for friendly users.  The services are still being configured and
tuned and so there may be rough edges, but tzchat.org accounts created now should
remain indefinitely.

One quirk is that the entry pages refer to "tezos.modular.im" rather that
"tzchat.org". Our service is hosted by modular.im and tezos.modular.im is the actual
"homeserver" host for tzchat.org accounts. We are working to change the pages to hide
that internal name.

Any Matrix account created at tzchat.org is new and independent of any existing
Matrix account, those at matrix.org in particular. If you create a tzchat.org
account and login with it:

+ You'll have to rejoin any rooms of interest.

+ If you had special permissions (moderator, etc) on an old account you'll have login to
that old account and grant those permissions to your new account if you so wish.

+ If you want to rejoin any private rooms (including "People" rooms, also known
as DMs) you'll have to invite your new account from your old one, or ask a room member
to do that for you.
