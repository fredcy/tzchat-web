The [Riot/Matrix services for tzchat.org accounts](https://riot.tzchat.org) are
now available for friendly users.  The services are still being configured and
tuned and so there may be rough edges, but tzchat.org accounts created now should
remain indefinitely.

One quirk is that the entry pages refer to "tezos.modular.im" rather that
"tzchat.org". Our service is hosted by modular.im and tezos.modular.im is actual
"homeserver" for tzchat.org accounts. We are working to change the pages to hide
that internal name.
