Here are some popular[^1] places to chat about [Tezos](https://tezos.com/)

[^1]: No doubt what's here is a biased view of what's available. [Additions and corrections](https://github.com/fredcy/tzchat-web/issues) to the list of chat places are welcome.

## Riot (Matrix)

+ [riot.tzchat.org](https://riot.tzchat.org) is the **Riot** host for the
[new **tzchat.org** server in *Matrix*](/pages/tzchat),
home to Tezos chat rooms with the
bantering of OGs dating back to mid 2017.  Register there for a tzchat.org
account; login and launch Riot from there to access all Tezos rooms in Matrix.
[#tezos:matrix.org](https://riot.tzchat.org/#/room/#tezos:matrix.org) is the main chat room for Tezos on Matrix. 

+ [riot.im](https://riot.im) is the Riot host for existing matrix.org accounts.

## Telegram

+ [Tezos Platform](https://t.me/tezosplatform) is the TG home to many more Tezos
OGs who like lots of the same gifs[^2] in their chat.
[^2]: Just kidding.

+ [Tezos Announcements](https://t.me/TezosAnnouncements) is a finely curated announcement-only room of the best Tezos news.

## IRC

+ `#tezos` channel on freenode
(bridged to [#tezos room](https://riot.tzchat.org/#/room/#freenode_#tezos:matrix.org) on Matrix) was started by Tezos core devs back in the day and still has top tech minds lurking and helping out.
`/join #tezos`.

## Slack

+ Obsidian runs a [Baking Slack](https://tezos-baking.slack.com).
Important announcements to the baking community often happen here first.
Bakers jointly resolve tech problems, including Ledger issues.
If you bake Tezos you want to at least follow announcements here.
Request an invitation at [tezos@obsidian.systems](mailto:tezos@obsidian.systems).

## Discord

If Tezos is being frequently discussed in Discord, those servers are not well known in the above chat worlds
