Here are some popular[^1] places to chat about [Tezos](https://tezos.com/)

[^1]: No doubt what's here is a biased view of what's available. [Additions and corrections](https://github.com/fredcy/tzchat-web/issues) to the list of chat places are welcome.

## Riot / Matrix

+ [riot.tzchat.org](https://riot.tzchat.org) is the Riot host for the
[new *tzchat.org* server](/pages/tzchat) in the *Matrix* federation,
home to chat rooms with the
bantering of Tezos OGs since early 2017.  Register there for a tzchat.org
account; login and launch Riot from there to access rooms in Matrix.
[Get started](/pages/get-started).

+ [riot.im](https://riot.im) is the Riot host for existing matrix.org accounts, accessing the same Matrix rooms as riot.tzchat.org.

## Telegram

+ [Tezos Platform](https://t.me/tezosplatform) is the TG home to many Tezos
OGs who like lots of the same gifs[^2] in their chat.
[^2]: Just kidding.

+ [Tezos Announcements](https://t.me/TezosAnnouncements) is a curated announcement-only room of Tezos news.

## IRC

+ `#tezos` channel on freenode IRC
(bridged to [#tezos room](https://riot.tzchat.org/#/room/#freenode_#tezos:matrix.org) on Matrix) was started by Tezos core devs back in the day and still has top tech minds lurking and helping out.  
`/join #tezos`

## Slack

+ Obsidian runs a [Baking Slack](https://tezos-baking.slack.com).
Important announcements to the baking community often happen there first.
Bakers jointly resolve tech problems, including Ledger issues.
If you bake Tezos you want to at least follow announcements there.
Request an invitation at [tezos@obsidian.systems](mailto:tezos@obsidian.systems).

## Reddit

The [/r/tezos](https://www.reddit.com/r/tezos/) subreddit is active and has an associated [subchat](https://www.reddit.com/chat/r/tezos/channel/497913_1e264cb668b5398d174558c97dc597bfa9e8944c). Talk about prices in [/r/tezostrader](https://www.reddit.com/r/tezostrader/).

Here's [an invitation link](https://discord.gg/VyngBFT).

## Discourse

The [Tezos Agora Forum](https://forum.tezosagora.org/) is a place to discuss and learn about the long-term direction of the Tezos project.

## Tezos Stack Exchange

While the above chat rooms can be a good source of interactive help, the [Tezos
StackExchange](https://tezos.stackexchange.com/) site has the answers to many
questions about Tezos and is a good place to post new questions.
