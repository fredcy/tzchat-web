The team developing the Riot app for Matrix regularly make a **beta version with new features, improvements, and fixes** available as a web app[^webapp] at https://riot.im/develop

[^webapp]: Sounds fancier than just "browser tab".

Just login there with your usual Matrix username and password. If you have a [tzchat.org](https://tzchat.org) account (or any non-matrix.org account) you should use your full Matrix username[^mxid] as username, something like `@myusername:tzchat.org`.

[^mxid]: "mxid"

Once logged in, open up user settings (click your name at upper left and then choose `Settings`), click the `Labs` tab, and select beta features to enable by moving their control slider to green status.
