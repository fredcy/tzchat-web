The team developing the Riot app for Matrix regularly make a **beta version with new features, improvements, and fixes** available as a web app[^webapp] at https://riot.im/develop

[^webapp]: Sounds fancier than just "browser tab".

Just login there with your usual Matrix username and password. If you have a [tzchat.org](https://tzchat.org) account (or any non-matrix.org account) you should use your full Matrix username[^mxid] as username, something like `@myusername:tzchat.org`.

[^mxid]: "mxid"

Once logged in, open up user settings (click your name at upper left and then choose `Settings`), click the `Labs` tab, and select beta features to enable by moving their control slider to green status.

[^2]: Access user settings by clicking your name at the upper left of the app and choosing the `Settings` item.

Some interesting settings[^3] include these:

##### Edit messages after they have been sent

This provides a way (via a pencil icon when hovering over a message) to edit ones own posted messages. Other Riot-develop users[^all] will see the edit happen in place. Regular Riot users will see a second amended message.

##### React to messages with emoji

This allows anyone (by hovering over a message and then the smily-face) to add a reaction emoji to any message, chosen from a small set of system-defined emojis. Other Riot-develop users[^all] will see any emojis (with their counts) for each message; other Riot users will have no clue.

[^all]: Perhaps they have to have the same feature enabled? I don't know.

[^3]: The available settings will likely change over time. If this note goes out of date, please open an issue on the content.
