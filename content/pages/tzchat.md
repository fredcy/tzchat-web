Thanks to a
[grant](https://tezos.foundation/news/tezos-foundation-supports-tezos-riot-forum)
from the [Tezos Foundation](https://tezos.foundation) the Tezos community has a
Riot (Matrix) [server at tzchat.org](https://riot.tzchat.org) of its own.  Riot accounts homed
on that server are likely to have faster response times compared to the
overloaded servers[^1] for matrix.org accounts.

To **register** a new account at tzchat.org, visit the [entry
page](https://riot.tzchat.org/#/welcome) and use `Create Account`. Providing an
email address there will allow you to reset your password later, but that's
optional.  If you have an existing Riot/Matrix account at matrix.org there is no
need to create a new one but you may wish to anyway to get better performance in
Riot.

To **login** to a tzchat.org account, visit the same [entry
page](https://riot.tzchat.org/#/welcome).

For a list of some popular Tezos rooms, visit the [home/directory page](https://riot.tzchat.org/#/home) and click `View Rooms`.

[^1]: The matrix.org servers are overloaded because they are the default for new Matrix/Riot users and are provided for free by New Vector who do a heroic job in providing and maintaining the free service.
