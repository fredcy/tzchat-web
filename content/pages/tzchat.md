Thanks to a
[grant](https://tezos.foundation/news/tezos-foundation-supports-tezos-riot-forum)
from the [Tezos Foundation](https://tezos.foundation) the Tezos community has a
Riot (Matrix) [server at tzchat.org](https://riot.tzchat.org) of its own.  Riot accounts homed
on that server are likely to have faster response times compared to the
overloaded servers[^1] for matrix.org accounts.

To **register** a new account at tzchat.org, visit the [entry
page](https://riot.tzchat.org/#/welcome) and use `Create Account`. Providing an
email address there will allow you to reset your password later, but that's
optional.  If you have an existing Riot/Matrix account at matrix.org there is no
need to create a new one but you may wish to anyway to get better performance in
Riot.

To **login** to a tzchat.org account, visit the same [entry
page](https://riot.tzchat.org/#/welcome). For username use your complete
Matrix account ID[^2], a value like `@myusername:tzchat.org`.

For **mobile and desktop app users**: As above, enter your full Matrix account ID as username. That allows the client to automatically find your homeserver.

For a list of some popular Tezos rooms, visit our [Riot home page](https://riot.tzchat.org/#/home) and click `View Rooms`. The room directory is also available via the "+" next to ROOMS in the left tab in Riot.

[^1]: The matrix.org servers are overloaded because they are the default for new Matrix/Riot users and are provided for free by New Vector who do a heroic job in providing and maintaining the free service.

[^2]: Some client apps have an "advanced" login mode where you can specify the "Homeserver URL". If you should need to do that, the Homeserver URL for tzchat.org is `tezos.modular.im`. But this should not be necessary if you provide your full Matrix ID as the username.
