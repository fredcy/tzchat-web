## Register for a tzchat.org account.

Visit https://riot.tzchat.org and click `Create Account`.

Fill in the "Create your account" form. Choose your username carefully as others can see it and you will not be able to change it.[^1]
Entering an email address[^2] is optional but if you forget your password the only way to recover it is via email. Click the `Register` button.

If you provided an email address above, check for a welcome message and follow the verification link provided there.

[^1]: You can, however, change your "display name" later, which is the most prominent name that others see about your account.

[^2]: In order to use email to recover your password you must use a different email address for each tzchat.org account you create.

## Login via Riot

Visit https://riot.tzchat.org and click `Sign In`. Enter your username[^3] and password and click `Sign In` (again).

[^3]: If you have any trouble signing in, or are signing into Riot on a mobile or desktop app, try using your full username of the form `@myusername:tzchat.org` (rather than just `myusername`). Don't forget the `@`.

## Join rooms

Once signed in, click the `+` next to ROOMS in the left pane to see a directory of some major rooms. Click a room name of interest, then click the `Join the discussion` button to join that room.

A few rooms require an invitation to join. If interested, after introducing yourself in a public room, ask for an invitation.

## Get help

See the FAQ pages for [TzChat](/pages/tzchat-faq) and [Riot](/pages/riot-faq) on this site.

You can also ask for help in any of the rooms and someone should steer you in the right direction.
